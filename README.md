Portfolio Optimization

## Motivation

Create a becktesting infrastructure for testing different porfolio optimization strategies and evaluation against different benchmarks

1) Backcasting requires agents that will participate in the simulation. In order for agents to participate in the simulation they need a prediction(Weight-Allocation) model, which is responsible for predicting the necessary values/weights.
2) The current implementation doesnt save the weights. It outputs the simulation results against the benchmarks we have decided we want to show.

## SETUP

*pip install -r requirements.txt*
